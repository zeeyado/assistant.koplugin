# KOReader Assistant Plugin

A powerful AI assistant integrated into KOReader.

You can:

- Have general chats (no context)
- Select books and chat about them (using metadata lke title, author, etc)
- Use and create custom actions to compare books, find common themes, etc
- Hihglight text in a book and have it explained, or chat about it, etc
- Save and continue chats 
- Use different AI models (for speed/depth, etc)
- Map functions to gestures and pop up menus for quick actions
- Much more using custom prompts/actions

A wiki will be made for creating custom prompts and actions, and other advanced configuration and usage. 

Originally forked from [ASKGPT by Drew Baumann](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt). See Credits and history at the bottom of this readme

This plugin was made for personal use and made public in case it is useful. Many functions are still under development, and many are untested. More providers will be added shortly. feel free to open a feature request or issue, or start a discussion.

NB: Gemini and Deepseek have not been thorougly tested for response format. Anthropic and OpenAi have been tested well.

## Quick Minimal Setup

**Get started in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Install the plugin**

Download: (Code (at top right of this page) -> Download ZIP. 

or Clone: `git clone https://github.com/zeeyado/assistant.koplugin`

or Download latest release (not yet available)

Rename and place in your KOReader plugins directory:

   ```
   # Kobo/Kindle: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   # Android: /sdcard/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   # macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   ```


2. **Add your API key(s)**

Copy the sample file `apikeys.lua.sample` and rename to `apikeys.lua`

Add at least one API key  
 
3. **Restart KOReader** - You're ready to go! Set your desired provider and model in the settings UI (Tools -> page 2 -> Assistant (under "More tools")

### Minimum Requirements

- KOReader version 2023.04 or newer
- At least one API key from: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/), [Google](https://aistudio.google.com/) (more providers are being added)

## HIGHLY Recommended Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Gestures for Quick Access

**Basic one time steps ease of use**

Examples (my usage preference; you can use whichever gestures you like):

**In Reader View (while reading) and in File browser:**

- Go to Settings â†’ Gesture Manager â†’ Tap corner â†’ Bottom left
- General â†’ (add all Assistant actions -- Chat history, Continue last chat, Chat about book, etc)
- Select "Show as QuickMenu"
-

You have to do this for both Reader view and File browser. This will give you an easy to access Assistant menu.

You can also assign any gesture to any action as you see fit.

### 2. Enable/disable prompts and create custom actions

- Go to Asstant settings -> Prompts & Responses -> Manage prompts
- Enable/disable the builtin prompts
- Create you own custom prompts in custom_prompts.lua


### 3. Getting Started Tips

- **Well-formatted metadata** enhances AI responses - use e.g Calibre or Zotero to ensure your books and papers have proper titles, authors, and ISBNs
- **Adjust highlight settings** - Set shorter tap duration for single words in Settings â†’ Taps and Gestures
- **Choose your model wisely** - Fast models for quick queries, powerful models (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4) for complex analysis (you can create custom prompts using specific models to override the default for that prompt)

    },
    {
        text = "Book Club Questions",

## Credits & History

### Fork History

Originally forked from [ASKGPT by Drew Baumann](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt) in February 2025, expanded with some features (prompts customization and multiple providers, etc) and renamed to Assistant, at which point it was forked by others, and these forks are still in development. It was then taken private (and thus out of the fork network) for focused development and re-released publicly in July 2025, in a much expanded state.
