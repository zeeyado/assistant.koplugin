# KOReader Assistant Plugin

A powerful AI assistant integrated into KOReader.

You can:

- Have general chats (no context)
- Select books and chat about them (using metadata lke title, author, etc)
- Use and create custom actions to compare books, find common themes, etc
- Hihglight text in a book and have it explained, or chat about it, etc
- Save and continue chats 
- Use different AI models (for speed/depth, etc)
- Much more using custom prompts/actions

A wiki will be made for creating custom prompts and actions, and other advanced configuration and usage.

## Quick Minimal Setup

**Get started in 3 simple steps:**

Download: (Code (at top of this page) -> Download ZIP

or Clone:

or Download latest release

1. **Install the plugin**
   Download: (Code (at top of this page) -> Download ZIP
   or Clone: `git clone https://github.com/zeeyado/assistant.koplugin`
   or Download latest release

   ```bash
   # Clone or download this repository, or grab the latest release
   git clone https://github.com/zeeyado/assistant.koplugin

   # Rename and place in your KOReader plugins directory:
   # Kobo/Kindle: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   # Android: /sdcard/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   # macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/koreader/plugins/assistant.koplugin/
   ```
2. **Add your API key(s)**

   ```bash
   # Copy the sample file and rename
   cp apikeys.lua.sample apikeys.lua

   # Edit apikeys.lua and add at least one API key
   ```
3. **Restart KOReader** - You're ready to go! Set your desired provider and model in the settings UI.

### Minimum Requirements

- KOReader version 2023.04 or newer
- At least one API key from: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/), [Google](https://aistudio.google.com/), or local Ollama (more providers are being added)

## HIGHLY Recommended Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Gestures for Quick Access

**Basic one time steps ease of use**

**In Reader View (while reading):**

- tGo to Settings â†’ Gesture Manager â†’ Multiswipe
- Assign "Assistant: Ask" to a two-finger swipe
- Assign "Assistant: Quick Translate" to another gesture

**In File Browser:**

- Assign "Assistant: General Chat" for quick AI conversations
- Assign "Assistant: Settings" for easy configuration access

### 2. Optimize Your Reading Experience

- **Well-formatted metadata** enhances AI responses - use e.g Calibre or Zotero to ensure your books and papers have proper titles, authors, and ISBNs
- **Adjust highlight settings** - Set shorter tap duration for single words in Settings â†’ Taps and Gestures
- **Choose your model wisely** - Fast models (Claude Haiku, GPT-4o-mini) for quick queries, powerful models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4) for complex analysis (you can create custom prompts using specific models to override the default for that prompt)

### 3. Getting Started Tips

- **Free tier options**: DeepSeek offers generous free usage, Anthropic and OpenAI have free trials
- **Local option**: Use Ollama for completely offline AI (requires a computer running Ollama server)
- **Quick vs Quality**: Claude Haiku and GPT-4o-mini are lightning fast, while Claude Sonnet and GPT-4o provide superior analysis

## Credits & History

### Fork History

Originally forked from [ASKGPT by Drew Baumann](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt) in February 2025, expanded with some features (prompts customization and multiple providers, etc) and renamed to Assistant, at which point it was forked by others, and these forks are still in development. It was then taken private (and thus out of the fork network) for focused development and re-released publicly in July 2025, in a much expanded state.
